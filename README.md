# Full Stack Developer
## SysAd > Web > Mobile

## I am *available* for work:
* Frontend & Backend Implementation (React, Next.JS, Remix, Node > MySQL, MariaDB, GraphQL, NoSQL, Firebase) 
* SysAd work (MySQL, MariaDB, Linux, WinServer, etc.)

## Work:
* Built most of the frontend on [tenelos.com](https://www.tenelos.com/)
* Worked on very unique FiveM lua scripts and techniques which can be found on my [forum.cfx.re account](https://forum.cfx.re/u/jgabt/summary)
* Currently working on [onlyph.com](https://onlyph.com); A very *"unique"* idea where I connect Filipino Students, Coursemates with each other and hopefully help them make friends; **First Idea** was also *"unique"*: OnlyFans but for Filipinos, since I saw a trending hashtag on Twitter that's very down bad lol, so why not profit off of it?

## How I started:
I built and maintained my own FiveM servers (Linux Servers, Databases, Lua Scripting) and eventually started tinkering with web stuff (React, Node, MariaDB, Auth)!
